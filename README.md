## About This Project

This project was created as part of my undergraduate thesis for the New College of Florida. There are many known issues including those with CORS, Typeform, etc.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.

### Project Abstract 

Research indicates that effective time management skills play a critical role in student outcomes. Providing students with tools and resources for managing their time can improve academic performance, lower stress, and enhance health. This thesis presents NCF To-Do'er, a web-based to-do list application that offers assistance with time management skills. Unlike other to-do list applications, NCF To-Do'er is explicitly designed for students. When making a to-do list, students are given the option to answer a brief questionnaire. This feature provides students with time estimates and priorities for their tasks, automating vital time management skills. NCF To-Do'er provides another tool to complement the current resources at New College. This application could assist students in appointments at the college's Student Success Center. Additionally, since students' performance in their first year is critical to their long-term success, the college's first-year SET SAIL seminars could use the application to promote time management skills. NCF To-Do'er was created using Angular, a web development framework, and written in HTML, SCSS, and Typescript programming languages. The application integrates with a third-party question-asking platform, making calls to the platform's API and utilizing data from it to produce a downloadable, prioritized to-do list.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project currently will not run the Typeform embed. For security reasons the access token cannot be shared on Github. In addition, Typeform is a paid service and the payments are no longer being made, so this does not work!
